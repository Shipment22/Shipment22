# Welcome to shipment22's GitHub!

## About Me
Why hello there! I'm Shipment22, also known by the term "neck beard Linux user," my other Github accounts are [benjamman](https://github.com/benjamman) and [shipment22ka](https://github.com/shipment22ka); This is my casual Github account, so don't always expect production ready code. I started coding with Khan Academy in the early middle of 2019, where I created numerous programs and participated in contests such as Primavera. You can explore that on my other account [shipment22ka](https://github.com/shipment22ka).

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### KAP Archive
[KAP Archive](https://kap-archive.bhavjit.com/) is a project close to my heart. It's a website aimed at preserving the legacy of Khan Academy programs and resources. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its development at [shipment22/kap-archive](https://github.com/shipment22/kap-archive).

### Distraction Blocker
In today's world full of distractions, staying focused can be a challenge. That's why I'm working on [benjamman/Distraction-Blocker](https://github.com/benjamman/distraction-blocker), a tool designed to help users minimize distractions and stay productive.

### Sleuth
I've also contributed to [KestronProgramming/Sleuth](https://github.com/KestronProgramming/Sleuth), a meta search engine developed to combat the rise of Internet tracking and enhance digital investigations. The name "Sleuth" stands for "Search Leveraging External Unified Tools for Hunting," reflecting its core functionality of leveraging external tols and resources to aid in hunting down information.

## Bobert
Meet Bobert, represented as an orange blob, whom I've created in my coding adventures. Bobert may just pop up in some of my projects.

He also has his own organization [bobertism](https://github.com/bobertism).

I created Bobert using a drawing tool that I made years ago. Interestingly, he was the first creation saved in the tool's initial save file. Upon loading back into the drawing tool, Bobert even had a birthmark, an artifact due to color conversion. Fun fact: Bobert was named by Virtuosa in the Khancord Discord server.
